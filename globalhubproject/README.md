***This is an interface for a pizza ordering system.***

I wanted to show you how it looks in my system just in case it looks different for you-because I guess tkinter makes it look different for some reasons-.

- So here is the first part of our gui. There are our pizza choices as radiobuttons, sauce choices as checkboxes and lastly our menu which is filled with buttons.

And the second part of the gui looks like this. There are payment details and and order button.

❔**So how does our gui work?** 

✅Let's order a pizza to see this.

Here we chose Classic pizza as our pizza and olives and mushrooms as our sauces.
